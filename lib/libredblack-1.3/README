README file
===========

This is a small library that provides the red-black balanced tree algorithm.
It's provided in two forms; as a linkable library and as a code generator that
can be used to create customized versions with a simpler API and better
performance.

If this code is raw out of the CVS tree, you will have to do the following to
compile it:-

sh ./autogen.sh

NOTE: When you have done a 'make install', you should check that /etc/ld.so.conf
contains the directory /usr/local/lib, and you should also probably run
/sbin/ldconfig to make sure that ld.so's cache file is up to date.
